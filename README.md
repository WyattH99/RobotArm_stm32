# RobotArm_stm32

This repo contains the projects for my STM32 Nucleo-F446RE based Robotic Arm project.

All Projects were developed using STM32CubeIDE and STM32_HAL.

The first project in this repo is the "PotentiometerToServo" project. This is were I developed the base understanding of mapping the potentiometers to their corresponding servo.

After Printing and Assembling the Arm I created the "RobotArm_stm32" project. In which is the finished code for the STM32.
